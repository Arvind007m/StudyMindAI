Vision Document: AI Study Assistant



Vision Statement
To revolutionize learning by helping users retain knowledge, not just consume it, through intelligent, personalized, and memory-first study tools powered by AI.
We aim to become the world's most effective self learning and memory enhancement platform, turning raw content into deep understanding and long-term retention.

Problem Statement

* AI tutor conversations trained on your content

* Voice-based audio learning sessions

* Concept reframing with metaphors and analogies

* Smart daily review reminders

* Confidence-based memory simulations

* Organized topic-based collections

* Gamified mastery progress with XP and badges



The platform uses spaced repetition, AI tutoring, and recall simulation to ensure real understanding and retention based on your unique content and pace.
